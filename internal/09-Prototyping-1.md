## Intro (4:30, 10 mins)

## Hanmail exmaple (4:40, 3 mins)

- what are some good techniques?

# In-class Paper Prototyping (4:45, 30 mins)
Walk around and give suggestions
- ask students "what task are you prototyping?"
- many groups try to build the whole thing. make sure to encourage them to focus on the "core experience."


# Diff with Reading


# Post Class Notes
- how would you paper prototype xxx worked quite well
	- but many of the answers are "add a separate sheet"
	- might benefit from more diversity
- spent too much time in the earlier part of the course
	- probably too many videos
- show tools: from the physical toolbox, show what's available and encourage students to use them.
- d.tools: students don't seem to "get" it that much.
- prototyping session went really well, students were highly engaged
- not enough time to do the testing, though.
- Protopiper examples worked very well.
