- gong sound helped quite a bit

Students have to clear the board twice for each new phase. Ask them to take a photo of the board and clear.

2017: Setup takes 20-30 mins at least. Make sure to arrive early and put up the poster boards (전지) on the wall. Some had hardboards in the middle.

2018: Every group had a hardboard paper as their main canvas.
