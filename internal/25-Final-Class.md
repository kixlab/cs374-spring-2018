Here's the self and peer evaluation form for the design project. Please submit your individual response by 11:59 pm on June 24th (Sunday).

For clarification, those of you who have completed the form without the self-assessment, it's okay to not separately send it to us. It's optional.

Also, these responses will not affect your grade in any way. The goal is to mainly understand the teamwork experience you had this semester while also giving you a chance to reflect.
